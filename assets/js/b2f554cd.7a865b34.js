This trip had marked me, it was very different from the ones I\'ve done before because it was full of discoveries.   \\nI was moving around a lot, so I didn\'t get much rest, but that was the beauty of this trip. Every day there was something new to discover.\\n\\n\\n## Athens\\n\\nIn Athens, I took an Airbnb that was a bit out of the center, but I had the metro line right next to the apartment. \\nI made this choice in order to save money on accommodation.   \\nThe neighborhood was really nice, with a supermarket right next door and very typical little cafes nearby. \\n\\nI was also very happy not to be in the city center, because Athens is a very touristic city. \\nIt\'s always noisy and I wouldn\'t have been able to get a good night\'s sleep. \\n\\n\\n<img src=\\"/img/greece/athens/athens_map.png\\" style={{width:\\"70%\\", display: \\"block\\", margin: \\"auto\\", borderRadius: \\"50%\\"}} role=\\"img\\" /> <br />\\n\\nAthens is **THE** city to do, everything is incredible, the streets, the atmosphere and especially the number of historical sites to visit !   \\nEvery day, I took the metro from my small apartment to the center and then did everything on foot. It was very tiring but it allowed me to see as much of the city as possible. \\n\\nThe fact that I did everything on foot meant that I got lost in some streets, and even though I had my phone with me, I preferred to try to wander around and find my way on my own.   \\nIt also meant that I could talk to locals or tourists to find my way back, and most importantly, ask for advice on what to visit in the area.\\n\\nI had the chance to visit Athens in early June, prices were reasonable because there weren\'t many tourists.  \\nBut, when I came back at the end of June, prices were very excessive. \\nIn some places, such as souvenir stores, the prices had almost doubled !\\n\\n:::tip\\n- When you eat or have a drink, the waitress will always bring you a glass of water and refill it when you run out. \\nIt\'s a gesture that I think shows how much the Greeks care about others. \\n\\n- Do not hesitate to go outside the center, for example from Kallithea where I was (metro: 10 minutes from the center). \\nThe area may not seem the best at first glance, but you\'ll be safe and have everything you need close by ! \\n\\n- If you want to visit monuments such as the Acropolis, or any of the other historical monuments, if you\'re under 25 and a citizen of the European Union, \\nyou can visit these monuments free of charge with proof of identity (identity card or passport).\\n:::\\n\\n\\nexport const athens = [\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_temple.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 480,\\n      height: 640,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens__acropolis_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 480,\\n      height: 640,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_church.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 520,\\n      height: 640,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_monastiraki_flea_market.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 480,\\n      height: 640,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_museum.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 480,\\n      height: 640,\\n   },\\n   //{\\n   //   src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_pillars.jpg\').default,\\n   //   width: 480,\\n   //   height: 640,\\n   //},\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_acropolis_3.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 480,\\n      height: 640,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_status.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 480,\\n      height: 640,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_temple_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 480,\\n      height: 640,\\n   },\\n   //{\\n   //   src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/athens/athens_acropolis.jpg\').default,\\n   //   width: 480,\\n   //   height: 640,\\n   //}\\n];\\n\\n<Gallery images={athens} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={250}/>\\n\\n## Naxos\\n\\nThis island is simply gorgeous; it\'s a little Mykonos, only better. \\nDespite the fact that there is more and more tourism, it has not yet reached the level of Mykonos.       \\nAs a result, this splendid blue-and-white island is still very affordable and, above all, much more pleasant to walk around and enjoy the Greek atmosphere.\\n\\nI ate the best ice cream of my life at the \\"Waffle House\\". \\n\\nI stayed in a hostel run by a local man, Alexandros, offering really affordable rooms just a 3-minute walk from the beach. \\nIt was a bit out of the center, but an easy 20 minute walk along the beach.\\n\\nAlexandros gave me great advice, and thanks to him I was able to get a great deal on a scooter from Scooter Mania and visit the right places, as Naxos is the largest island in the Cyclades.                             \\nThanks to him, I was able to swim in the magnificent beaches on the west side of the island and not waste my time with too many trips to the center of the island.\\n\\n:::caution\\nBe careful when you rent a scooter to check with the company if you have to return it with a full tank or not. \\nI was tricked, I put a full tank in my scooter because when I picked it up it was almost empty and I didn\'t even use a quarter of it, but the company didn\'t reimburse me for the overfill...\\n:::\\n\\nexport const naxos = [\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/naxos/naxos_sunset.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 3024,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/naxos/naxos_street.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1833,\\n      height: 3413,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/naxos/naxos_door.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 3024,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/naxos/naxos_beach_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 3024,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/greece/naxos/naxos_beach.JPG\').default,\\n      width: 2160,\\n      height: 3840,\\n   }\\n];\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n<Gallery images={naxos} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={300}/>\\n\\n<br />\\n\\n## Paros\\n\\nThe atmosphere is completely different, everything is much greener and drier. It is mostly very mountainous. \\n\\nI stayed in a guesthouse and I really didn\'t regret it! My hosts were very welcoming. \\nI was able to talk to them at length about their lives, mine, and all sorts of other things.   \\nIt was very enriching to be able to have such conversations and, above all, it allowed me to greatly improve my spoken English ! \\n\\nI only rented a scooter in the city center for 2 days because I wanted to fully explore the island. \\nThen I took the bus to continue my tour because there was a bus stop close to my room.\\n2 days to visit the whole island was not enough, I recommend to do it in 3 days to have time and not be in a hurry. \\n\\nI don\'t really recommend the northeast of the island, which is beautiful but too touristy, with lots of restaurants with big terraces that \\"spoil\\" the landscape.\\n\\nOn the 4th day, I got an alert on my phone that there was a big risk of a storm, which was very impressive because my phone started to ring by itself.   \\nSo my hosts offered to take me to a supermarket to stock up on supplies in case we couldn\'t get out.

I started with 1 week in Malta and then 3 weeks in Italy.\\n\\n## Malta\\nI was very surprised by the beauty of Malta\'s landscapes.   \\nI\'d researched places to go before, but seeing them with my own eyes was even more amazing. \\n\\nI really enjoyed this part of the trip because we were in a big house with many other foreigners (Turkish, Colombian, German,...). \\nAnd we had the opportunity to talk, eat and drink with them.\\n\\nThe tourists were mostly teenagers from all over the world. We met a lot of young people who came to work for the summer season.\\nThey were usually handing out flyers for organized parties, visits, activities,...\\n\\nWe had to live in a community, there were rules in the house so that everyone behaved well.\\nIt was interesting to see how people managed to do with the rules.\\n\\nMalta is not an expensive destination, but during the summer season and especially in the big cities (Paceville, Valetta,...) prices are the same as in France.\\n\\nThere is a real contrast in social wealth across the island. In fact, it is not uncommon to see magnificent buildings surrounded by dilapidated ones.\\n\\n### Advices\\nYou must see *Blue Grotto* (sea caves). The water and light reflections are beautiful and worth seeing !\\n\\n:::tip\\nIf you want to have a wonderful experience, go to Blue Grotto early in the morning. \\n:::\\n\\nexport const malta = [\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_church.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 640,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_groto.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 640,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_groto_water.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 640,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_little_port.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 705,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_yachts.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 705,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_party_street.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 4100,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   }\\n];\\n\\n<Gallery images={malta} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={250}/>\\n\\n## Italy\\nDuring my trip in Italy, I had the opportunity to explore Bari, Rome, Florence, Pisa,...\\n\\n### Bari\\nI do not recommend this city for a long stay, there is not much to do and discover.\\nEspecially because there are not many historical monuments and places to visit. I think it is a good destination for 2 or 3 days maximum.\\n\\nCompared to Malta, Bari is very affordable, a bottle of Peronni (Italian beer) costs 1\u20ac, pizza\'s were sold for 6\u20ac and cocktails 7\u20ac.\\n\\nWe had the chance to be there during the final of the 2021 European footbal tournament.

To get there you have to take the regional train (tickets cost about 5\u20ac).\\n- Visit the historical center, there are many typical small streets\\n- Go to the *Piazza Mercantile*, it is a place with a lot of restaurants, bistros, cafes, animations,...\\n- Explore the 13th-century Norman-Swabian castle of Bari\\n\\nexport const bari = [\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/randoms/bari_train_station.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2016,\\n      height: 1512,\\n    },\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/bari_poli.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2016,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/bari_center_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 1800,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/bari_street.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 1800,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/bari_beach.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 1800,\\n   }\\n];\\n\\n<Gallery images={bari} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={250}/>\\n\\n### Rome\\nI highly recommend visiting Rome, I think 7 days is perfect to visit the city and all it\'s monuments and places.   \\n\\nRome is a city full of museums, squares, Roman buildings and other must-sees. \\nI strongly advise you equip yourself with good walking shoes. The city is so large and interesting that long distances can be covered quickly...\\n\\n\\n#### What you must do ?\\n- Visit the Pantheon, the Colosseum, the Circus Maximus, the Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum\\n- The Vatican and the Sistine Chapel\\n- Enjoy traditional pasta with a glass of wine at ```Pasta e Vino Osteria```. It is someone we met during our trip who recommended this address to us. \\nIt is considered as the best place to taste real Italian pastas with the typical Italian atmosphere.\\n- Visit the Trastevere neighborhood. The area is one of the oldest and most authentic neighborhoods in Rome and is definitely the place to be in Rome for nightlife.\\n- If you have time you can go to Castel Gandolf. It is commonly known as the *Pope\'s City*, as it houses the Pope\'s summer residence. \\nThere is a train that can take you there.\\n\\nexport const roma = [\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_trevi.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2016,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_roman_forum_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2216,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_pastas.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 3024,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_coliseum.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2212,\\n      height: 1816,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_street_4.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_vaticano_out.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2316,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_vaticano_in.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1650,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_street.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 3624,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_street_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2116,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_street_3.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2016,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_roman_forum.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1712,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   }\\n];\\n\\n<Gallery images={roma} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={250}/>\\n\\n### Florence\\nOur host was a Greek living in Italy.

He even taught us how to make an excellent espresso with a Moka Pot.\\n\\nHe talked about his daily life and his life in Greece (which planted a seed in my mind). We shared many things, how we see life, \\nour cultural habits, how important it is for us to travel and open ourselves to the world.\\n\\nOur host took us to see his friends, then we ate street food. There were many people selling their goods (drinks, food,...). \\nIt is a common thing in Italy to pay for something to drink and sit somewhere in public and discuss. \\n\\n#### What to do ?\\n- Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore\\n- Piazzale Michelangelo at sunset / at night. It offers a panoramic view of Florence.\\n- Ponte Vecchio, it\'s the oldest bridge in Florence.
