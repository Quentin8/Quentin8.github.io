My trip was divided into 2 parts. I started with 1 week in Malta and then 3 weeks in Italy.

## Malta
I was very surprised by the beauty of Malta's landscapes.   
I'd been researching places to go before, but seeing them with my own eyes was even more amazing. 

I really have enjoyed this part of the trip because we were in a big house with many other foreigners (Turkish, Columbian, German,...). 
And we had the opportunity to discuss, share meals and take a drink with them. 

Tourists were mainly teenagers coming from all over the globe. We met a lot of young people coming to work for the summer season. 
They were usually promoting flyers for organised parties, visits, activites,...

We had to live in a community, they were rules in the house so that everyone behave good. 
It was interesting to see how people managed to do with the rules.

Malta isn't an expensive destination, but during the summer season and especially in the big cities (Paceville, Valetta,...) prices are the same as in France.

There's a real contrast in social wealth across the island. In fact, it's not uncommon to see magnificent buildings surrounded by dilapidated ones.

### Advices
You must see *Blue Grotto* (sea caverns). The water and the reflections of the light are beautiful and well worth seeing !

:::tip
If you wan't a wonderfull experience, go there at the early morning.

## Italy
During my trip in Italy I had the opportunity to explore Bari, Rome, Florence, Pisa,...

### Bari
I don't recommend this city for a long stay, there is not much things to do and discover.
Especially because there is not a lot of hystoric monuments and places to visità. I think it's a good destination for 2 or 3 days maximum.

Compared to Malta Bari is very affordable, the bottle of Peronni (Italian beer) cost 1€, pizza's were sold arrount 6€ and cocktails 7€.

We had the chance to be there during the final of the 2021 European footbal tournament. Italy won against England and the city was crazy, Italians were celebrating everywhere on the streets.  

Here is a picture reflecting the atmosphere this night :

<br />

#### What to do ?
- You can go to Polignano a Mare, it's a little balnear station 30 minutes away. To get there you need to take the regional train (tickets costs arround 5€).
- Visit the historical center, there are many typical small streets
- Go to the *Piazza Mercantile*, it's a place with a lot of restaurants, bistro's, coffees, animations,...
- Explore the 13th-century Norman-Swabian Castle of Bari

];

### Rome
I highly recommend visiting Rome, I think 7 days is perfect to visit the city and all it's monuments and places.   
Rome is a city brimming with museums, squares, Roman buildings and other must-sees. 
I strongly advise you equip yourself with good walking shoes.   
The city is so large and interesting that long distances can be rapidly covered...



#### What you must do ?
- Visit the Pantheon, the Coliseum, the Circus Maximus, Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum
- The Vatican and the Sistine Chapel
- Enjoy traditional pastas with a glass of wine at ```Pasta e Vino Osteria```. It's someone we met during our trip that recommended us the adress. 
It is considered as the best place to taste real Italian pastas with the typical Italian atmosphere.
- Visit the Trastevere neighbourhood. The area is one of the oldest and most authentic neighbourhoods in Rome and is definitely where to stay in Rome for nightlife.
- If you have time you can go to Castel Gandolf. It's commonly known as the *Pope's City*, as it houses the Pope's summer residence. 
There is a train line that can bring you there.

### Florence
Our host was a Greek living in Italy. He gave us a lot of advices and took us to places where only local population goes.

He cooked us pastas with pestos, offered us Chianti wines (regional wine). He even taught us how to make an excellent espresso with Moka Pot.

Shared about his daily life and his life in Greece (which planted a seed in my mind). We shared many things together, how we see the life, our cultural habits, how important is it to us to travel and open ourselves to the world. et le fait de voyager et de s'ouvrir.

Vasselyo brings us to see his friends, then we ate street food. They were many people selling their goods (drinks, foods,...). 
It's a common thing in Italy to pay something to drink and sit somewhere in public and discuss. 

#### What to do ?
- Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore
- Piazzale Michelangelo at the sunset / at nigth. It offers a panoramic view of Florence.
- Ponte Vecchio, it's the oldest bridge in Florence. He's known for the many shops on and around the bridge, which used to be the domain of blacksmiths, tanners and butchers. But they were replaced by jewelers and goldsmiths.

:::tip
If you wan't to spend a fantastic evening, you need to sip a cocktail at ``View on Art Rooftop Cocktail Bar``. 
It's Rooftop restaurant with a stunning view of the Duomo and great music.

### Pisa
Pisa was the last stop of our trip. We stayed there only a day and it was enough for us. I suggest to stay there for 2 days because there is not many things to do and see.

- See and visit the Tower of Pisa
- Visit the Duomo di Pisa
- See the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Spina (a gothic church located on the bank of the Arno river)
- Borgo Stretto, it's Pisa's shopping street

## Learning
- I spoke and shared moments with international peoples
- Had the opportunity practice my spoken English
- Italians people lives during the evening and lately
- They are dangerous drivers (they are always over the speed limits, stop and trafic light are not respected)
