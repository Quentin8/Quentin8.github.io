My trip was divided into 2 parts. I started with 1 week in Malta and then 3 weeks in Italy.

## Malta
I was very surprised by the beauty of Malta's landscapes.   
I'd researched places to go before, but seeing them with my own eyes was even more amazing. 

I really enjoyed this part of the trip because we were in a big house with many other foreigners (Turkish, Colombian, German,...). 
And we had the opportunity to talk, eat and drink with them.

The tourists were mostly teenagers from all over the world. We met a lot of young people who came to work for the summer season.
They were usually handing out flyers for organized parties, visits, activities,...

We had to live in a community, there were rules in the house so that everyone behaved well.
It was interesting to see how people managed to do with the rules.

Malta is not an expensive destination, but during the summer season and especially in the big cities (Paceville, Valetta,...) prices are the same as in France.

There is a real contrast in social wealth across the island. In fact, it is not uncommon to see magnificent buildings surrounded by dilapidated ones.

### Advices
You must see *Blue Grotto* (sea caves). The water and light reflections are beautiful and worth seeing !

:::tip
If you want to have a wonderful experience, go to Blue Grotto early in the morning.

## Italy
During my trip in Italy, I had the opportunity to explore Bari, Rome, Florence, Pisa,...

### Bari
I do not recommend this city for a long stay, there is not much to do and discover.
Especially because there are not many historical monuments and places to visit. I think it is a good destination for 2 or 3 days maximum.

Compared to Malta, Bari is very affordable, a bottle of Peronni (Italian beer) costs 1€, pizza's were sold for 6€ and cocktails 7€.

We had the chance to be there during the final of the 2021 European footbal tournament. Italy won against England and the city went crazy, 
Italians were celebrating everywhere in the streets.  

Here is a picture that reflects the atmosphere of this night:

<img src="/img/Italy/bari_party.jpg" style={{width:"70%", display: "block", margin: "auto", borderRadius: "2%"}} role="img" />

<br />

#### What to do ?
- You can go to Polignano a Mare, it's a little balnear station 30 minutes away. To get there you have to take the regional train (tickets cost about 5€).
- Visit the historical center, there are many typical small streets
- Go to the *Piazza Mercantile*, it is a place with a lot of restaurants, bistros, cafes, animations,...
- Explore the 13th-century Norman-Swabian castle of Bari

];

### Rome
I highly recommend visiting Rome, I think 7 days is perfect to visit the city and all it's monuments and places.   

Rome is a city full of museums, squares, Roman buildings and other must-sees. 
I strongly advise you equip yourself with good walking shoes. The city is so large and interesting that long distances can be covered quickly...


#### What you must do ?
- Visit the Pantheon, the Colosseum, the Circus Maximus, the Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum
- The Vatican and the Sistine Chapel
- Enjoy traditional pasta with a glass of wine at ```Pasta e Vino Osteria```. It is someone we met during our trip who recommended this address to us. 
It is considered as the best place to taste real Italian pastas with the typical Italian atmosphere.
- Visit the Trastevere neighborhood. The area is one of the oldest and most authentic neighborhoods in Rome and is definitely the place to be in Rome for nightlife.
- If you have time you can go to Castel Gandolf. It is commonly known as the *Pope's City*, as it houses the Pope's summer residence. 
There is a train that can take you there.

### Florence
Our host was a Greek living in Italy. He gave us a lot of advice and took us to places where only locals go.

He cooked us pasta with pesto, offered us Chianti wine (regional wine). He even taught us how to make an excellent espresso with a Moka Pot.

He talked about his daily life and his life in Greece (which planted a seed in my mind). We shared many things, how we see life, 
our cultural habits, how important it is for us to travel and open ourselves to the world.

Our host took us to see his friends, then we ate street food. There were many people selling their goods (drinks, food,...). 
It is a common thing in Italy to pay for something to drink and sit somewhere in public and discuss. 

#### What to do ?
- Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore
- Piazzale Michelangelo at sunset / at night. It offers a panoramic view of Florence.
- Ponte Vecchio, it's the oldest bridge in Florence. It is known for the many shops on and around the bridge, 
which used to be the domain of blacksmiths, tanners and butchers. But they were replaced by jewelers and goldsmiths.

:::tip
If you want to spend a fantastic evening, you need to sip a cocktail at ``View on Art Rooftop Cocktail Bar``. 
It is a rooftop restaurant with a stunning view of the Duomo and great music.

### Pisa
Pisa was the last stop of our trip. We only spent one day there and it was enough for us. I suggest to stay there for 2 days because there are not many things to do and see.

- See and visit the Tower of Pisa and the Duomo di Pisa
- See the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Spina (a gothic church located on the bank of the Arno river)
- Borgo Stretto, the shopping street of Pisa

    {
      src: require('@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_tower.jpg').default,

## Learnings
- Talked and shared moments with international people
- Had the opportunity to practice my spoken English
- Italians live in the evening and lately
- They are dangerous drivers (they always exceed the speed limits, stop and traffic lights are not respected)
