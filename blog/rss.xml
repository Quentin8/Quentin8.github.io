We chose Italy because many friends recommended us the destination and for it's landscapes and it's cultural richness.
Italy was a dream, who doesn't dream about discovering Italy and </p><p><a href="/blog/malta-italy"><strong>Read more</strong></a></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="portugal">Portugal<a href="#portugal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Portugal" title="Direct link to Portugal">​</a></h4><p>Then, in 2022, I set myself the challenge of going off on my own for 2 weeks. It was my first time ! I went to Portugal for multiple reasons :</p><ul><li>It's near France (if something had happened I could have come back to France rapidly)</li><li>I didn't knew much about Portugese culture and habits</li><li>I wanted to discover it's architectural wealth</li></ul><p><a href="/blog/portugal"><strong>Read more</strong></a></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="greece">Greece<a href="#greece" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Greece" title="Direct link to Greece">​</a></h4><p>Finally, in 2023, I decided to conquer Greece. I loved going off on my own, so I repeated the adventure this time for 3 weeks. I chose Greece on the recommendation of friends, as well as people I had met on previous trips. They recommended it to me, as the Greek islands are very safe places to travel alone.</p><p><a href="/blog/greece"><strong>Read more</strong></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="photo-dump">Photo dump<a href="#photo-dump" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Photo dump" title="Direct link to Photo dump">​</a></h2><div id="ReactGridGallery" class="ReactGridGallery"><object tabindex="-1" type="text/html" data="about:blank" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;height:100%;width:100%;pointer-events:none;z-index:-1;opacity:0"></object><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap"></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I'd been researching places to go before, but seeing them with my own eyes was even more amazing. </p><p>I realy enjoyed this part of the trip because we were in a big house with many other foreigners (Turkish, Columbian, German,...). And we had the opportunity to discuss, share meals and take a drink with them. </p><p>Tourists were mainly teenagers coming from all over the globe. We met multiple times teanagers like doing seasonnal works. They were usually promoting flyers for organised parties, visits, activites,...</p><p>Lived in a community, they were rules in the house so that everyone behave good.</p><p>Malta isn't an expensive destination, but during the summer season and especially in the big cities (Paceville, Valetta,...) prices are the same as in France.</p><p>There's a real contrast in social wealth across the island. In fact, it's not uncommon to see magnificent buildings surrounded by dilapidated ones.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advice">Advice<a href="#advice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advice" title="Direct link to Advice">​</a></h3><p>You must see <em>Blue Grotto</em> (sea caverns).

Especially because theres is not a lot of hystoric monuments and places to visits. I think it's a good destination for 2 or 3 days maximum.</p><p>Compared to Malta Bari is very affordable, the bottle of Peronni (Italian beer) cost 1€, pizza's were sold arrount 6€ and cocktails 7€.</p><p>We had the chance to be there during the final of the 2021 European footbal tournament.
