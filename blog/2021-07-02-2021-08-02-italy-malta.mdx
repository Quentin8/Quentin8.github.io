My trip was divided into 2 parts. I started with 1 week in Malta and then 3 weeks in Italy.

## Malta
I was very surprised by the beauty of Malta's landscapes. I'd been researching places to go before, but seeing them with my own eyes was even more amazing.<!--There's a real contrast in social wealth across the island, Valletta (capital).--> And there is a lot of teenagers coming from all over the globe. We met many international teanagers doing seasonnal works : they give flyers for parties, visits, activites,...

I realy enjoyed this part of the trip because we were in a big house with many other foreigners (turk, columbian, german,...). We had the opportunity to share meals and drinks with them. We met many people there because  it was like a youth hostel.

Lived in a community, they were rules in the house so that everyone behave good. We shared meals and 

## Italy
During my trip in Italy I had the opportunity to explore Bari, Roma, Firenze, Pisa,...

### Bari
I don't recommend this city for a long stay, there is not much things to do and discover.
Especially because theres is not a lot of hystoric monuments and places to visits. I think it's a good destination for 2 or 3 days maximum.

We were in Bari the during the final of 2021 European footbal tournament; Italy won against England, a lot of Italians were on the streets celebrating.  

Here is a picture reflecting the atmosphere this night :

#### What to do ?
- You can go to Polignano a Mare, it's a little balnear station 30 minutes away. for this you need to take the regional train (the ticket costs approximately 5€).
- Visit the historical center, there is a lot of typical small streets
- Go to the *Piazza Mercantile*, it's a place with a lot of restaurants, bistro's, coffees, singers,...
- Explore the 13th-century Norman-Swabian Castle of Bari

### Roma
I highly recommend visiting Rome, I think 7 days is perfect to visit the city and all it's monuments and places. I strongly advise you equip yourself with good walking shoes. The city is so large and interesting that long distances can be rapidly covered..

Rome is a city brimming with museums, squares, Roman buildings and other must-sees.

#### What to do ?
- Trevi Fountain
- Enjoy traditional pastas with a glass of wine at **Pasta e Vino Osteria**. It's someone we met during our trip that recommended us the adress. It's considered as the best place to taste real Italian pastas with the typical Italian atmosphere.
- Visit the Coliseum, the Circus Maximus, Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum
- The Pantheon
- The Vatican and the sixteen chapelle
- Roman forum
- Voir le quartier de Trastevere (quartier typique italien où vous pouvez vous perdre dans le labyrinthe de petites ruelle regorgeant de bars et ruelles)
- If you have time you can go to Castel Gandolfo, this is commonly known as the *Pope's City*, as it houses the Pope's summer residence. There is a train line that can bring you there.

### Firenze
Our host Vasselyo was a Greek living in Italy. Gave us a lot of advices and take us to places where only local people goes.

Shared about is life and Greece (which planted a seed in my head). 
What to do ?
### Pisa
What to do ?
No more than 2 days because not many things to do. 

We only stayed for a complete day and it was perfect.

## Learning
- I spoke and shared moments with international peoples
- Had the opportunity practice my spoken English
- Italians people lives during the evening and lately
- They are dangerous drivers (they are always over the speed limits, stop and trafic light are not respected)
