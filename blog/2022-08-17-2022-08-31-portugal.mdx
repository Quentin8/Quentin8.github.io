I decided to travel alone. I had the opportunity to discover 2 beautiful cities :
* Lisbon (capital city of Portugal) for **5 days**
* Porto for **10 days**

If I had to do it all over again, I'd spend a little more time in Lisbon, because there's so much to see. 
I didn't have time to go to Sintra (a beautiful town near Lisbon).


## Lisbon

Lisbon is a city that makes you want to explore, to discover what might be in every neighborhood, on every street. 
It’s a safe and friendly city, relatively small but with so much to see. It is the ideal place to spend a few days.

Lisbon is a very hilly city, I've covered most of it on foot ! Lucky I have got good legs and good shoes. 

Lisbon is full of nooks and crannies, little streets with hidden stores or cafés with loudly laughing people inviting you in for a drink. 
I wish I'd spent more time in Lisbon, it is a city where you can easily feel at home.

You **must** go to ``Pasteis de Belem`` and eat their Pastel de nata ! (they are the best in Portugal)

## Porto

It is the same country, but with such different landscapes.   
Just between the west and north of Porto, the landscapes are very different. More industrial 
landscapes with old buildings in the north, while in the west there is much more green, life, shops, etc....   
The atmosphere in Porto was very different from the one in Lisbon. Porto is alive day and night and there are more young people in Porto than in Lisbon. 

During my breaks in bars or cafés after my long walks, I had the opportunity to chat with locals.
This helped me improve my English, even though not all the Portuguese I met spoke English.   
Thanks to them, I was able to go to places to eat and visit that I'd never have thought of !

 
Being alone in the same city for 10 days was very pleasant, but long.
I would not recommend spending that much time alone in the same city because there were times when I didn't know what to do.   
But on the positive side, it really allowed me to take the time to do nothing, 
enjoy every moment and be more aware of everything around me.

   {
      src: require('@site/static/img/portugal/porto_art.jpg').default,

:::tip 

You can do everything on foot or by using the old tramway or buses. You will only need to rent a car or scooter only if you are planning to move out of the city. 
It is a city with excellent transportation links.
