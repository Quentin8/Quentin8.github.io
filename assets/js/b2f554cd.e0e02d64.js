I started with 1 week in Malta and then 3 weeks in Italy.\\n\\n## Malta\\nI was very surprised by the beauty of Malta\'s landscapes. I\'d been researching places to go before, but seeing them with my own eyes was even more amazing. \\n\\nI realy enjoyed this part of the trip because we were in a big house with many other foreigners (Turkish, Columbian, German,...). And we had the opportunity to discuss, share meals and take a drink with them. \\n\\nTourists were mainly teenagers coming from all over the globe. We met multiple times teanagers like doing seasonnal works. They were usually promoting flyers for organised parties, visits, activites,...\\n\\nLived in a community, they were rules in the house so that everyone behave good.\\n\\nMalta isn\'t an expensive destination, but during the summer season and especially in the big cities (Paceville, Valetta,...) prices are the same as in France.\\n\\nThere\'s a real contrast in social wealth across the island. In fact, it\'s not uncommon to see magnificent buildings surrounded by dilapidated ones.\\n\\n### Advice\\nYou must see *Blue Grotto* (sea caverns). The water and the reflections of the light are beautiful and well worth seeing !\\n\\n:::tip\\nIf you wan\'t a wonderfull experience, go there at the early morning.\\n:::\\n\\nexport const malta = [\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_church.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 640,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_groto.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 640,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_groto_water.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 640,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_little_port.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 705,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_yachts.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 705,\\n      height: 480,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/malta/malta_party_street.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 4100,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   }\\n];\\n\\n<Gallery images={malta} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={250}/>\\n\\n## Italy\\nDuring my trip in Italy I had the opportunity to explore Bari, Rome, Florence, Pisa,...\\n\\n### Bari\\nI don\'t recommend this city for a long stay, there is not much things to do and discover.\\nEspecially because theres is not a lot of hystoric monuments and places to visits. I think it\'s a good destination for 2 or 3 days maximum.\\n\\nCompared to Malta Bari is very affordable, the bottle of Peronni (Italian beer) cost 1\u20ac, pizza\'s were sold arrount 6\u20ac and cocktails 7\u20ac.\\n\\nWe had the chance to be there during the final of the 2021 European footbal tournament. Italy won against England and the city was crazy, Italians were celebrating everywhere on the streets.  \\n\\nHere is a picture reflecting the atmosphere this night :\\n\\n![Italian Win](/img/Italy/bari_party.jpg)\\n\\n\\nla ville est une sorte de quadrillage dont les rues en sens unique\\n\\n#### What to do ?\\n- You can go to Polignano a Mare, it\'s a little balnear station 30 minutes away. for this you need to take the regional train (the ticket costs approximately 5\u20ac).\\n- Visit the historical center, there is a lot of typical small streets\\n- Go to the *Piazza Mercantile*, it\'s a place with a lot of restaurants, bistro\'s, coffees, animations,...\\n- Explore the 13th-century Norman-Swabian Castle of Bari\\n\\nexport const bari = [\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/bari_poli.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2016,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/bari_street.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/randoms/bari_train_station.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2016,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/bari_center_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/bari_beach.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   }\\n];\\n\\n<Gallery images={bari} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={250}/>\\n\\n### Rome\\nI highly recommend visiting Rome, I think 7 days is perfect to visit the city and all it\'s monuments and places. I strongly advise you equip yourself with good walking shoes. The city is so large and interesting that long distances can be rapidly covered..\\n\\nrome is a city brimming with museums, squares, Roman buildings and other must-sees.\\n\\n#### What you must do ?\\n- Visit the Coliseum, the Circus Maximus, Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum\\n- The Pantheon\\n- The Vatican and the Sistine Chapel\\n- The Roman forum\\n- Enjoy traditional pastas with a glass of wine at ```Pasta e Vino Osteria```. It\'s someone we met during our trip that recommended us the adress. It\'s considered as the best place to taste real Italian pastas with the typical Italian atmosphere.\\n- Visit the Trastevere neighbourhood, the area is one of the oldest and most authentic neighbourhoods in Rome and is definitely where to stay in Rome for nightlife.\\n- If you have time you can go to Castel Gandolfo, this is commonly known as the *Pope\'s City*, as it houses the Pope\'s summer residence. There is a train line that can bring you there.\\n\\nexport const roma = [\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_trevi.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2016,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_pastas.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 3024,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_coliseum.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_roman_forum.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_roman_forum_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2216,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_vaticano_out.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2416,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_vaticano_in.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1650,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_street.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 3624,\\n      height: 4032,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_street_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2116,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_street_3.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 2016,\\n      height: 1512,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/roma_street_4.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   }\\n];\\n\\n<Gallery images={roma} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={250}/>\\n\\n### Florence\\nOur host Vasselyo was a Greek living in Italy. He gave us a lot of advices and took us to places where only local population goes.\\n\\nHe cooked us pastas with pestos, offered us Chianti wines (regional wine).\\n\\nShared about is life and his life in Greece (Which planted a seed in my mind). \\n\\nVasselyo brings us to see his friends, then we ate street food. They were many people selling their goods (drinks, foods,...). It\'s a common thing in Italy to pay something to drink and sit somewhere in public and discuss. \\n\\n#### What to do ?\\n- Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore\\n- Piazzale Michelangelo at the sunset / at nigth. It offers a panoramic view of Florence.\\n- Ponte Vecchio, it\'s the oldest bridge in Florence. He\'s known for the many shops on and around the bridge, which used to be the domain of blacksmiths, tanners and butchers. But they were replaced by jewelers and goldsmiths.\\n\\n\\n### Pisa\\nPisa was the last stop of our trip. We stayed there only a day and it was enough for us. I suggest to stay there for 2 days because there is not many things to do and see.\\n\\n- See and visit the Tower of Pisa\\n- Visit the Duomo di Pisa\\n- See the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Spina (a gothic church located on the bank of the Arno river)\\n- Borgo Stretto, it\'s Pisa\'s shopping street\\n\\nexport const pisa = [\\n    {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_tower.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_tower_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_battistero.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_church_3.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_church.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_church_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_street.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n   {\\n      src: require(\'@site/static/img/Italy/pisa_street_2.jpg\').default,\\n      width: 1512,\\n      height: 2016,\\n   },\\n];\\n\\n<Gallery images={pisa} enableImageSelection={false} rowHeight={250}/>\\n\\n## Learning\\n- I spoke and shared moments with international peoples\\n- Had the opportunity practice my spoken English\\n- Italians people lives during the evening and lately\\n- They are dangerous drivers (they are always over the speed limits, stop and trafic light are not respected)"}]}')}}]);
