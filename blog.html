I went to Portugal for several reasons :</p><ul><li>It&#x27;s close to France (if something had happened, I could have come back to France quickly)</li><li>I didn&#x27;t knew much about Portugese culture and habits</li><li>I wanted to discover its architectural richness</li></ul><p><a href="/blog/portugal"><strong>Read more</strong></a></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="greece">Greece<a href="#greece" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Greece" title="Direct link to Greece">​</a></h4><p>Finally, in 2023, I decided to conquer Greece. I enjoyed traveling alone, so I have started the adventure all over again, but this time for 3 weeks.<br>
<!-- -->I chose Greece on the recommendation of friends, as well as people I met on my previous trips.

<!-- -->Every day, I took the metro from my small apartment to the center and then did everything on foot.

<!-- -->It also meant that I could talk to locals or tourists to find my way back, and most importantly, ask for advice on what to visit in the area.</p><p>I had the chance to visit Athens in early june, prices were reasonable because there weren&#x27;t many tourists.<br>
