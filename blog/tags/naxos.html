I made this choice in order to save money on accommodation.<br>

<!-- -->Every day, I took the metro from my small apartment to the center and then did everything on foot. It was very tiring but it allowed me to see as much of the city as possible. </p><p>The fact that I did everything on foot meant that I got lost in some streets, and even though I had my phone with me, I preferred to try to wander around and find my way on my own.<br>
<!-- -->It also meant that I could talk to locals or tourists to find my way back, and most importantly, ask for advice on what to visit in the area.</p><p>I had the chance to visit Athens in early June, prices were reasonable because there weren&#x27;t many tourists.<br>
<!-- -->But, when I came back at the end of June, prices were very excessive.
