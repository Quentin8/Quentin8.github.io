I have decided to do this trip alone, but this time by going away for 3 weeks with a slightly more organized trip. 

My journey :

- **Athens**: 5 days

- **Naxos**: 5 days

- **Paros**: 6 days

- **Milos**: 5 days

- **Athens**: 2 days


My inter-island transport was all made by boat. This trip had marked me, it was very different from the ones I've done before because it was full of discoveries.   
I moved around a lot, so I didn't get much rest, but that was the beauty of this trip. Every day I had something new to discover, so I could take in even more than I had the day before.


## Athens

In Athens, I took an Airbnb a little bit out of the center but I had the metro line right next to the apartment. 
I made this choice in order to save money on accommodation.   
The neighborhood was really nice, with a supermarket right next door and very typical little caf√©s nearby.   
I was also very happy not to be in the city center, because Athens is a very touristic city. It's always noisy and I wouldn't have been able to get a good night's rest.

Athens is **THE** city to do, everything is incredible, the streets, the atmosphere and above all the number of historical sites to visit!   
From my small apartment to the center, I took the metro and then did everything on foot, which was very tiring but it enabled me to see as much of the city as possible. 

The fact that I did everything on foot meant that I got lost in some streets, and even though I had my phone with me, I preferred to try to wander around and find my way on my own.   
It also meant that I could talk to locals or tourists to find my way back, and above all ask for advice on what to visit in the area.

I have had the chance to visit Athens in early june, because they weren't much tourism, prices were reasonable.  
But, when I came back at the end of june, prices were very excessive. 
In some places, such as souvenir stores, prices had almost doubled !

:::tip
- When you eat or have a drink, the waitress will always bring you a glass of water, which he or she will refill as soon as you run out. 
It's a gesture that I think shows just how much Greeks like to look out for others. 

- Do not hesitate to stray from the center, for example from Kallithea where I was. 
The area may not seem the best at first glance, but you'll be safe and with everything you need nearby! 

- If you want to visit monuments such as the Acropolis, or any of the other historical monuments, if you're under 25 and a citizen of the European Union, 
you can visit these monuments free of charge with proof of identity (identity card or passport).

## Naxos

This island is just splendid; it is a little Mykonos, only better. 
Despite the fact that there is more and more tourism, it has not yet reached the level of Mykonos.       
As a result, this splendid blue-and-white island is still very affordable and, above all, much more pleasant to stroll around and enjoy the Greek atmosphere.

I ate the best ice cream of my life at Waffle House. 

I slept in a hostel run by a local, Alexandros, offering really affordable rooms just a 3-minute walk from the beach. 
It was a little out of the center, but an easy 20-minute walk along the beach.

Alexandros gave me great advices, and thanks to him I was able to get a great deal on a scooter from Scooter Mania and visit the right places, as Naxos is the largest island in the Cyclades.                             
Thanks to him, I was able to swim in the magnificent beaches on the west side of the island and not waste my time making too many trips to the center of the island.

:::caution
Be careful when you rent a scooter to check with the company whether you have to return it with a full tank or not. 
I was tricked, I put a full tank in my scooter because when I picked it up it was almost empty and I didn't even use a quarter of it, but the company didn't reimburse me for the overfill...

## Paros

It is a completely different atmosphere here, everything is much greener and dryer. It is mostly very mountainous. 

I stayed in an guesthouse and I really didn't regret it! My hosts were very welcoming. 
I was able to talk to them at length about their lives, mine and all sorts of other subjects.   
It was very enriching to be able to have such conversations and, above all, it enabled me to greatly improve my spoken English! 

I only took a scooter in the city center for 2 days, as I wanted to tour the island for 2 days and then take the bus that stopped in front of the rooms to visit specific sites. 
2 days to visit the whole island was not enough, I recommend doing it in 3 days to have time and not be in a hurry. 

I don't really recommend the north-east of the island, which is pretty but very touristic, with lots of restaurants with large terraces that "spoil" the scenery.

On the 4th day, I received an alert on my phone because there was a big risk of a storm, which was very impressive because my phone started ringing by itself.   
So my hosts offered to take me to a super market to stock up on supplies in case we couldn't get out. It just goes to show how nice the Greeks are.   
Rest assured, in the end the storm didn't affect us too much and I was able to continue my visits.

:::info 
Take good walking shoes and a big hat, as there are very few shady areas and the climate is quite arid.

## Milos

Milos, oh great Milos. 

This island is just sumptuous! I have never seen such a small place with so much landscapes! Everything was majestic!   
I've never felt better than on this island, everything is beautiful, it's on a human scale so it's very pleasant to wander around. 

I rented a scooter from day one until the end of my stay, because I really wanted to take my time and make the most of this last week of my trip.  

Milos is a "mountain" island with lots of hairpin bends, and unfortunately I paid the price. 
On the first day, while trying to get to the island's big supermarket, I slipped on an oil puddle and fell.   
Luckily it was nothing serious, just a burn on my knee and shoulder.   
But the fall made me realize just how kind and good the Greeks are.   
Just after I'd picked up the scooter, a car immediately stopped and gave me water and towels to clean myself up.   
A few minutes later, a young man came up to me with a bottle of water, because he'd seen me fall and went off to buy me some water so that I could come to my senses and clean myself up. 

I couldn't even count the number of cars, scooters and quads that stopped to ask me how I was and if I needed anything.

:::tip
- Take a powerful quad bike and be very, very careful on the roads üòâ
- You must go to ``O! Hamos! Tavern``.  It is an authentic family owned Greek tavern.

:::caution
Be sure to check your travel dates, as on even-numbered days Blue Star Ferries goes to Milos, while on odd-numbered days only SeaJets operates. 
Bear in mind that Blue Star Ferries boats cost at least 4 times less than SeaJets boats.
