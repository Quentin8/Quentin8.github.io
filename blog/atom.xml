<!-- -->We chose Italy because many friends recommended us the destination, especially for it's landscapes and it's cultural richness.<br>
<!-- -->Italy was a dream, who doesn't dream of discovering Italy ?</p><p><a href="/blog/malta-italy"><strong>Read more</strong></a></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="portugal">Portugal<a href="#portugal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Portugal" title="Direct link to Portugal">​</a></h4><p>Then, in 2022, I set myself the challenge of traveling alone for 2 weeks. It was my first time !
I went to Portugal for several reasons :</p><ul><li>It's close to France (if something had happened, I could have come back to France quickly)</li><li>I didn't knew much about Portugese culture and habits</li><li>I wanted to discover its architectural richness</li></ul><p><a href="/blog/portugal"><strong>Read more</strong></a></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="greece">Greece<a href="#greece" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Greece" title="Direct link to Greece">​</a></h4><p>Finally, in 2023, I decided to conquer Greece. I enjoyed traveling alone, so I have started the adventure all over again, but this time for 3 weeks.<br>
<!-- -->I chose Greece on the recommendation of friends, as well as people I met on my previous trips.
They recommended it to me because the Greek islands are very safe places to travel alone.</p><p><a href="/blog/greece"><strong>Read more</strong></a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="photo-dump">Photo dump<a href="#photo-dump" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Photo dump" title="Direct link to Photo dump">​</a></h2><div id="ReactGridGallery" class="ReactGridGallery"><object tabindex="-1" type="text/html" data="about:blank" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;height:100%;width:100%;pointer-events:none;z-index:-1;opacity:0"></object><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap"></div></div>]]></content>

This trip had marked me, it was very different from the ones I've done before because it was full of discoveries.<br>
<!-- -->I was moving around a lot, so I didn't get much rest, but that was the beauty of this trip. Every day there was something new to discover.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="athens">Athens<a href="#athens" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Athens" title="Direct link to Athens">​</a></h2><p>In Athens, I took an Airbnb that was a bit out of the center, but I had the metro line right next to the apartment.
I made this choice in order to save money on accommodation.<br>
<!-- -->The neighborhood was really nice, with a supermarket right next door and very typical little cafes nearby. </p><p>I was also very happy not to be in the city center, because Athens is a very touristic city.
It's always noisy and I wouldn't have been able to get a good night's sleep. </p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/greece/athens/athens_map.png" style="width:70%;display:block;margin:auto;border-radius:50%" role="img" class="img_ev3q"> <br><p>Athens is <strong>THE</strong> city to do, everything is incredible, the streets, the atmosphere and especially the number of historical sites to visit !<br>
<!-- -->Every day, I took the metro from my small apartment to the center and then did everything on foot. It was very tiring but it allowed me to see as much of the city as possible. </p><p>The fact that I did everything on foot meant that I got lost in some streets, and even though I had my phone with me, I preferred to try to wander around and find my way on my own.<br>
<!-- -->It also meant that I could talk to locals or tourists to find my way back, and most importantly, ask for advice on what to visit in the area.</p><p>I had the chance to visit Athens in early june, prices were reasonable because there weren't many tourists.<br>
<!-- -->But, when I came back at the end of june, prices were very excessive.
In some places, such as souvenir stores, the prices had almost doubled !</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-tip alert alert--success admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.5 0C3.48 0 1 2.19 1 5c0 .92.55 2.25 1 3 1.34 2.25 1.78 2.78 2 4v1h5v-1c.22-1.22.66-1.75 2-4 .45-.75 1-2.08 1-3 0-2.81-2.48-5-5.5-5zm3.64 7.48c-.25.44-.47.8-.67 1.11-.86 1.41-1.25 2.06-1.45 3.23-.02.05-.02.11-.02.17H5c0-.06 0-.13-.02-.17-.2-1.17-.59-1.83-1.45-3.23-.2-.31-.42-.67-.67-1.11C2.44 6.78 2 5.65 2 5c0-2.2 2.02-4 4.5-4 1.22 0 2.36.42 3.22 1.19C10.55 2.94 11 3.94 11 5c0 .66-.44 1.78-.86 2.48zM4 14h5c-.23 1.14-1.3 2-2.5 2s-2.27-.86-2.5-2z"></path></svg></span>tip</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><ul><li><p>When you eat or have a drink, the waitress will always bring you a glass of water and refill it when you run out.

Despite the fact that there is more and more tourism, it has not yet reached the level of Mykonos.<br>
<!-- -->As a result, this splendid blue-and-white island is still very affordable and, above all, much more pleasant to walk around and enjoy the Greek atmosphere.</p><p>I ate the best ice cream of my life at the "Waffle House". </p><p>I slept in a hostel run by a local man, Alexandros, offering really affordable rooms just a 3-minute walk from the beach.
It was a little out of the center, but an easy 20-minute walk along the beach.</p><p>Alexandros gave me great advice, and thanks to him I was able to get a great deal on a scooter from Scooter Mania and visit the right places, as Naxos is the largest island in the Cyclades.<br>
<!-- -->Thanks to him, I was able to swim in the magnificent beaches on the west side of the island and not waste my time with too many trips to the center of the island.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-caution alert alert--warning admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z"></path></svg></span>caution</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Be careful when you rent a scooter to check with the company if you have to return it with a full tank or not.

It is mostly very mountainous. </p><p>I stayed in a guesthouse and I really didn't regret it! My hosts were very welcoming.
I was able to talk to them at length about their lives, mine, and all sorts of other things.<br>
<!-- -->It was very enriching to be able to have such conversations and, above all, it allowed me to greatly improve my spoken English! </p><p>I only rented a scooter in the city center for 2 days because I wanted to fully explore the island.
Then I took the bus to continue my tour because there was a bus stop close to my room.
2 days to visit the whole island was not enough, I recommend to do it in 3 days to have time and not be in a hurry. </p><p>I don't really recommend the north-east of the island, which is beautiful but very touristic, with lots of restaurants with large terraces that "spoil" the landscape.</p><p>On the 4th day, I got an alert on my phone that there was a big risk of a storm, which was very impressive because my phone started to ring by itself.<br>
<!-- -->So my hosts offered to take me to a supermarket to stock up on supplies in case we couldn't get out. It just goes to show how nice the Greeks are.<br>
<!-- -->Rest assured, in the end the storm didn't affect us too much and I was able to continue my visits.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Take good walking shoes and a large hat, as there is little shade and the climate is quite dry.</p></div></div><br><div id="ReactGridGallery" class="ReactGridGallery"><object tabindex="-1" type="text/html" data="about:blank" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;height:100%;width:100%;pointer-events:none;z-index:-1;opacity:0"></object><div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap"></div></div><br><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="milos">Milos<a href="#milos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Milos" title="Direct link to Milos">​</a></h2><p>Milos, oh great Milos. </p><p>This island is just gorgeous !

<!-- -->I've never felt better than on this island, everything is beautiful, it's on a human scale so it's very pleasant to walk around. </p><p>I rented a scooter from the first day until the end of my stay, because I really wanted to take my time and make the most of this last week of my trip.  </p><p>Milos is a "mountain" island with lots of hairpin bends, and unfortunately I paid the price.
On the first day, while trying to get to the island's big supermarket, I slipped on an oil puddle and fell.<br>
<!-- -->Fortunately, it was nothing serious, just a burn on my knee and shoulder.<br>

<!-- -->I'd researched places to go before, but seeing them with my own eyes was even more amazing. </p><p>I really enjoyed this part of the trip because we were in a big house with many other foreigners (Turkish, Colombian, German,...).
And we had the opportunity to talk, eat and drink with them.</p><p>The tourists were mainly teenagers from all over the world. We met a lot of young people who came to work for the summer season.
They were usually handing out flyers for organized parties, visits, activities,...</p><p>We had to live in a community, there were rules in the house so that everyone behaved well.
It was interesting to see how people managed to do with the rules.</p><p>Malta is not an expensive destination, but during the summer season and especially in the big cities (Paceville, Valetta,...) prices are the same as in France.</p><p>There is a real contrast in social wealth across the island. In fact, it is not uncommon to see magnificent buildings surrounded by dilapidated ones.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advices">Advices<a href="#advices" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advices" title="Direct link to Advices">​</a></h3><p>You must see <em>Blue Grotto</em> (sea caves).
